# WhatIf
This project is for studying Multiplicative Persistence.
The multiplicative persistence of a number is the amount of times all the digits of that number can be multiplied together without resulting in a single digit number
I was inspired to create this after watching NumberPhile on Youtube

multiplicativePersistence.java allows a user to input a number and outputs the persistence of a number along with its multiplicative digital root

simulation.java takes two bounds and finds the smallest number with the highest persistence between the bounds

simulationv2.java was a bit of a personal interest (I mean this all was a personal interest but regardless...) to find how fall my computer can run the program.

Apparently at the speed of my computer, it will take ~2000 centuries for me to go through all the numbers from 0 to the max long value. :(
Hopefully, somebody may be able to go through it all for my stead.

The highest persistence found so far was 11 and the number is 277777788888899.
